Example 3.10: A Galton board is a board in which a large number of BB-shots are dropped from a chute at the top of the board and deflected off a number of pins on their way down to the bottom of the board. We are going to simulate this

```{r}
# Define the parameters
require(plyr)
max_trials <- 100000
rows_of_pins <- 50
p <- 0.5

# Set up the graph of the binomial distribution
x <- 0:rows_of_pins
y <- dbinom(x, rows_of_pins, p)

# Run the Galton board simulation
galton <- matrix(runif(rows_of_pins*max_trials), ncol=rows_of_pins)
galton_logic <- (galton < p)
galton_movement <- mapvalues(galton_logic, c(TRUE, FALSE), c(1, 0))
trials <- rowSums(galton_movement)

# Plot the result
hist(trials, breaks=0:rows_of_pins, xlab='Final Position')
lines(x-0.5,y*max_trials)

```
