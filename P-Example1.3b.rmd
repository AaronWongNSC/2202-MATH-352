Example 1.3b: If you roll a pair of dice 24 times, is it more common to roll a pair of 6s or to not roll a pair of 6s? What about for 25 rolls?

```{r}
# The plyr package has the mapvalues function
require(plyr)

# Define the parameters
max_trials <- 10000
num_rolls <- 25

# Create a matrix that has max_trials*num_rolls rows and 2 columns. This represents the dice being rolled in pairs.
demere <- rowSums(matrix(sample(1:6, 2*max_trials*num_rolls, replace=T), ncol=2))

# Convert each pair of dice into an individual success or failure and count the number of successes in each row. We consider a pair of 6s a success.
demere_successes <-
  rowSums(matrix(mapvalues(demere,
                           c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12),
                           c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)),
                 ncol=num_rolls))

# Convert the number of successes for each set of rolls into a logical value representing whether or not a pair of 6s was rolled.
trials <- (demere_successes > 0)

# Display the final results
barplot(table(trials), main=paste("A pair of 6s was rolled in", num_rolls, "attempts"))

summary(trials)
```
