# 2202-MATH-352
This is the repository for MATH 352 (Probability and Statistics) at Nevada State College for Spring 2020. It contains code snippets in R and Python to demonstrate various ideas from the course.

## Textbooks

Some of the code in this repository come from examples from the following textbooks:
* _Introduction to Probability_ by CM Grimstead, accessed from https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/amsbook.mac.pdf in November 2019.
* _Introduction to Statistics_ by David M. Lane et al, accessed from http://onlinestatbook.com/ in November 2019.

The naming convention is that files that start with P come from the _Probability_ book and files that start with S come from the _Statistics_ book. If the file starts with an A, then it's just something that I made that doesn't necessarily have any specific connection to either book.
