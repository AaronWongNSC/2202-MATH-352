Example 2.4: Suppose that two random real numbers in [0,1] are chosen and add them together. Let X be the sum. How is X distributed?

```{r}
# Define the parameters
max_trials <- 10000

# Pick two random values between 0 and 1.
first_value <- runif(max_trials)
second_value <- runif(max_trials)

# Compute X
X <- first_value + second_value

# Create the histogram
hist(X)
```
