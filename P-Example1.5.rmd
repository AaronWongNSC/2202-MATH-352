Example 1.5: Four Horses (Acorn, Balky, Chestnut, and Dolby) are run in many races. It is estimated that Acorn wins 30% of the time, Balky 40% of the time, Chestnut 20% of the time, and Dolby 10% of the time. Simulate the horse race.

```{r}
# Define the parameters
max_trials <- 10000

# Set up the possible outcomes
possible_outcomes <- c('Acorn','Balky', 'Chestnut', 'Dolby')

# Get the individual results
results <- sample(possible_outcomes, max_trials, replace=T, c(.3, .4, .2, .1))

# Display the final results
table(results)
barplot(table(results))
```
