Example 1.3a: If you roll a die 4 times, is it more common to roll a 6 or to not roll a 6?

```{r}
# The plyr package has the mapvalues function
require(plyr)

# Define the parameters
max_trials <- 1000

# Create a matrix that has max_trials rows and 4 columns. This represents the dice rolls.
demere <- matrix(sample(1:6, 4*max_trials, replace=T), ncol=4)

# Convert each individual roll into an individual success or failure and count the number of successes in each row. We consider a 6 a success.
demere_successes <-
  rowSums(mapvalues(demere, c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)))

# Convert the number of successes for each set of rolls into a logical value representing whether or not a 6 was rolled.
trials <- (demere_successes > 0)

# Display the final results
barplot(table(trials), main="A 6 was rolled in 4 attempts")
summary(trials)
```
