Example 1.4: We will flip a coin 40 times. Every time a head comes up we win a unit, and every time a tail comes up we lose a unit. Graph the wins or losses after each flip.

```{r}
# Define the parameters
max_trials <- 40

# Set up the possible outcomes
possible_outcomes <- c(-1,1)

# Get the individual results
results <- sample(possible_outcomes, max_trials, replace=T)

# Get the cululative results
cumulative <- cumsum(results)

# Plot the graph
plot(cumulative, type='l',
     main='Heads = +1, Tails = -1',
     xlab='Flips',
     ylab='Winnings')
```
